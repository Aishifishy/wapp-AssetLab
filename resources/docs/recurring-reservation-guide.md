# Laboratory Recurring Reservation Guide

## Overview

The wappResourEase system allows users to make recurring laboratory reservations that follow specific patterns (daily, weekly, or monthly). This guide explains how the system checks for conflicts and handles reservations across academic terms.

## Reservation Types

1. **Single Reservation**
   - A one-time reservation for a specific date and time
   - Simplest form of reservation

2. **Recurring Reservation**
   - Repeats on a pattern (daily, weekly, or monthly) until the specified end date
   - Allows users to reserve a regular timeslot without making multiple individual reservations

## Conflict Checking

The system performs comprehensive conflict checking to ensure your reservation doesn't overlap with:

1. **Existing single reservations**
   - Checks against all approved one-time reservations

2. **Existing recurring reservations**
   - Verifies that your reservation doesn't conflict with any instance of a recurring reservation
   - Takes into account different recurrence patterns

3. **Regular class schedules**
   - Prevents overlaps with scheduled classes in the laboratory
   - Respects the academic schedule

4. **Academic term boundaries**
   - Warns when a recurring reservation extends beyond the current academic term
   - Ensures reservations respect term boundaries

## Real-time Validation

The system provides immediate feedback when creating reservations:

- **Single Reservation Check**: Validates the selected time for conflicts
- **Recurring Reservation Check**: Validates all recurring dates for potential conflicts
- **Color-coded Indicators**: Green for available, Red for conflicts
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Identifies specific dates and conflict types

## Best Practices

1. **Plan ahead**: Make reservations well in advance, especially for recurring needs
2. **Check the calendar**: Review the laboratory calendar to see existing reservations
3. **Respect term boundaries**: Keep recurring reservations within the current academic term
4. **Be specific**: Provide accurate details about your purpose and student count
5. **Cancel when needed**: If you no longer need a reservation, cancel it promptly to free up the slot for others

## Need Help?

Contact the laboratory administrator for assistance with reservations or if you encounter any issues with the system.
